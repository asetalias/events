## Via Code

For starters, there is our club's repository [asetalias.github.io](https://github.com/asetalias/asetalias.github.io) to contribute by writing the front-end code for our website. Try this to get familiar with Git and GitHub. We will help in case you get stuck.

Once you get accustomed, it would be easier to pick up a project of your choice and go Open Source!

## Creating Issues

You have to create an issue in this repository for the listed tasks, and we will get back to you:

* In case you want to propose a talk on something you recently learnt or worked on.
* You can request for webinars and workshops on a certain field or topic we can help you introduce.
* An issue you find the management or any other process and we can help with.

Key: no redundancy. If something is already proposed that you want as well, add to the same issue if there is really anything to add. Making it redundant would make it difficult for us to help you with your interests :)

## Talks

In case, you have recently learnt something efficient enough to teach well or tell others about and would like to give a talk on, please propose a talk by creating an issue as mentioned above.

Things to mention in your issue of the proposal:

* Title of Talk
* About the talk. Few lines on the topic of talk and points to be covered.
* About the speaker.
* Social Links to your profile.
* Slides to your presentation (if any)

## Event Posters

Pull requests for the addition of event posters will only be accepted by their respective designers for kind acknowledgement of their contribution to the community.
