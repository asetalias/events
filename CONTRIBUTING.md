# Contributions

Welcome to the Events repository of ALiAS! Your contributions play a vital role in making our events successful and impactful. This guide outlines how you can contribute to this repository and provides instructions on submitting event posters and adding assets.

## Creating Issues

To address your requests or proposals, we kindly ask you to create an issue in this repository. Our team will review and respond to the following tasks:

- If you would like to propose a talk on a topic you have recently learned or worked on.
- If you would like to request webinars and workshops on a specific field or topic, and we can assist in introducing them.
- If you have identified any issues in the management or other processes that we can help address.

> **Note**:Please avoid redundancy, we encourage you to add your input to existing issues if they already cover your interests. Creating duplicate issues makes it challenging for us to effectively assist you. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this regard.

## Event Posters

We appreciate the contribution of event posters from designers in our community. If you have designed a poster for an event, you can submit it to the repository by creating a pull request. Please ensure the following:

- Create a directory for the event under the respective year directory, following the naming convention of MM-DD-Event-Name in PascalCase and kebab-case. For example, `2022/08-01-Job-Readiness`
- Place the poster in the event directory, naming it as `poster.png` for portrait orientation and `poster-landscape.png` for landscape orientation.
- Include a `README.md` file in the event directory to provide details and information about the event.
- Add any other assets related to the event in the event directory like presentation slides, illutrator artworks etc.

Designers are recognized and acknowledged for their valuable contributions to the community through the inclusion of their posters in the repository.
