# Event Contributions

Welcome to the Event Contributions repository of the ALiAS Club! This repository serves as a platform for speakers to register their talks and contribute to the success of our events. Additionally, it contains resources related to the events organized by the club.

## Registering Your Talk

To register your talk for an event or you want to request a event/workshop on a topic then please create an issue using the [event registration template](https://github.com/asetalias/Logistics-and-Event-Contributions/issues/new/choose). Fill out the necessary details in the issue to provide information about your talk/event.

## Event Planner

Planning an event requires careful consideration and organization. To ensure the success of our events, we have provided an Event Planner guide, which you can find in the [EventPlanner.md](EventPlanner.md) file. This guide contains valuable information, tips, and best practices for event planning.

We encourage event organizers to review the Event Planner guide to streamline the planning process and ensure a memorable and successful event.
