## About event

The event commenced with Sahil Jha and Vipul Goyal introducing the audience with Raspberry Pi and its application in IoT. Such applications helped the audience realise how amazing it is to see that only a few years back, it was virtually impossible for someone to have access to actual hardware to run IoT solutions. Solutions that are cheap and
reasonably-sized equipment that one shall easily deploy in a house, a car, or anywhere else. Nowadays, platforms
like Arduino, mbed, BeagleBone and Raspberry Pi are providing IoT developers with a wide ecosystem of hardware that
can be used to easily prototype and even go to production for small batches.

The event progressed from the basic on hardware and middleware components upto the sub components being microprocessors, single board computers (SBCs), sensors and peripherals for wireless connectivity. Sahil explained how SBCs are powerful and of multi-purpose while microprocessors being single-purpose are cheap yet efficient. The discussion later went on towards the explanation how SBCs and microprocessors manage to communicate with our sensors, and hence talking about its GPIO.

Before moving on to the practical work, Sahil introduced the enthralled audience to the basics of electronics that would ad in using RaspberryPi as a component in IoT. The speaker explained and exhbited breadboard, jumper wires, rotatory encoders, potentiometers, servos, and resistors. Audience was guided through writing code for Raspberry Pi from the basics to the demonstrations on the projects:

- Giving variable and digital output through touch sensor via LED lights,
- Switched controller buzzer, and
- Output via humidity and temperature sensors
