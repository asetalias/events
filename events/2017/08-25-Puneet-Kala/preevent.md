## [Pre-Event] Writeup on ASET ALiAS' Event  

# Are you Doing Enough By Mr Puneet Kala  

ASET ALiAS planned to organise it’s latest event on August 25, 2017 to be delivered by Mr Puneet Kala, and all gracious
thanks to our ALiAS member Shivam Rajput whose selection in Joomla as a GSoC intern led us to this day.  
  
Mr Puneet Kala has been associated with Google Summer of Code for over 4 years now. He is a GSoC admin 2016-17. He was
selected as a GSoC student in 2013 and has been a GSoC mentor since 2014. He is a Joomla core contributor and volunteer
for more than 5 years, currently leading the Google Summer of Code team for Joomla. He is also a member for Joomla’s
automation working since 2013. This software Engineer from Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Technology, has
more than 4.5 years of Industry experience. He worked in Oracle as a Senior Software Engineer. Currently and is a Global
Automation Leader for redWEB Aps.  
  
A lot of thought was applied amongst the members to come up with an apt topic for the event, once the speaker for the
event was finalised. Finally, it was decided that the event must discuss the less known industry trends and break myths
regarding the industrial selection process of individuals, while the contribution to Joomla and GSoC in general were
already finalised as the topics to be covered. Hence, the title “Are you doing enough?” was put forward.  
  
The event was organised alongside cooperation of the CRC. Hence, we had on board Dr Madhuri Kumari from CRC along with
our faculty members Dr Shilpi Sharma and Mrs Nidhi Chandra. They got us a venue allotted for a capacity of 200, and
helped us arrange for all the facilities required, as well assisted with keeping a backup when possible.  
  
With everything planned on time, we had a request from the Joomla society for a livestream of the event, after the event
became official on Joomla’s behalf on twitter and facebook. Even though the request was received a day before the event,
some time before end of working hours for the day, the college managed to serve us the requirement.  
  
Before the event started, the speaker was shown around the university by our member Shivam Rajput, which he was impressed
to see. Meanwhile, other team and faculty members ensured that everything was ready at the event venue with all the
requirements well satisfied. Thereafter, the event commenced with efficient application of ALiAS’ organisation skills.
