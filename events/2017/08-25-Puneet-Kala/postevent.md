The free open source event witnessed 160+ attendees who were there to unveil for themselves a good opportunity to learn
about the opportunity "Google Summer of Code". The speaker shared insights on industry trends and what your CV must have
to get you your dream job. He also shared his experience at Joomla and how one can be a part of it as well. The
attendees got to know about the various job designations available for pursuing and how one shall walk there way to
their dream position after BTech.

The event also made sure to discuss all the dilemma in a student’s mind and hence witnessed answers to among the top
asked questions. Mr Puneet Kala helped our attendee Sahil find direction to how to find his field of interest to pursue
in the presence of tons of fields available out there to work in such as Big Data, Machine Learning, etc. and huge
number of programming languages to write program in. Ashutosh, our attendee seemed more interested in opportunities
related to hardware and hence wanted to know how to get jobs in companies like Intel which are more hardware focused.
We also realised the presence of attendees who have not yet found coding interesting enough to work on and still desire
to work better and more efficient.  Professions like MDes are great for exploration for pursual for those!

Finally, we all collectively realised a pattern to everything we have ever wanted to know. And it was none other than
the thirst of curiosity that makes us explore. We have to explore anything and everything, and critically analyze our
desires and greater infatuation for the work we do. According to Mr Puneet Kala, we must do research work, take up
self-initiated as well as group projects, interact with the people of industry and go for internships as well as
externships. We then need to find answer for ourselves, that which work are we interested to work upon and for which
technology are we dedicated enough, that is when we will realise our actual field of interest.

Along with Mr Puneet Kala, our faculty members, Dr Shilpi Sharma and Mrs Nidhi Chandra, as well as Dr Madhuri Kumari
from the CRC department has helped the ALiAS members make this journey of exploration a success for the CSE students
and helped them know if they have been actually doing enough!
